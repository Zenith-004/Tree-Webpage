# Tree-Webpage
Interactive Tree Structures in Web Development

This webpage is a tree-like structure created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. it is used for implementing functionalities like adding nodes, toggling nodes, renaming nodes, and dynamically adding child nodes to both existing and newly created parent nodes. Additionally, we've tackled aspects like long-click functionality for renaming nodes and ensuring that the "+" button adds child nodes as expected. It allows you to create draggable text boxes that allows for a systematic way for note keeping.
